Geotechnical engineers are on site assessing the slope and determining the cause of the landslide, which officials believe was exacerbated by saturated soil conditions following consistent rainfall. No injuries have been reported.\n\nMDOT has established a detour using Northland Drive and Buchanan Road.

The area, centered around Cusseta, is characterized by agricultural land and scattered residential structures, and is also served by GA-26, US-280\/GA-520, and the Martha Berry Highway.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with extremely dry vegetation and wind gusts that are making containment challenging,\u201d said Georgia Forestry Commission spokesperson Wendy Burnett. \u201cOur priority is public safety and protecting structures in the area.\u201d\n\nAuthorities issued mandatory evacuation orders for residents within a one-mile radius of the fire\u2019s leading edge. A temporary shelter has been established at the Cusseta Community Center to accommodate those displaced. \n\nFirefighters from multiple counties, as well as the Georgia Forestry Commission, are battling the blaze using a combination of ground crews and aerial support. Air tankers were deployed to drop water and retardant on the fire throughout the day.\n\nThe cause of the wildfire remains under investigation. Officials are urging residents to avoid the area and to report any suspicious activity. Updates on the fire\u2019s progress and evacuation orders can be found on the Georgia Forestry Commission website and local news outlets.

County engineers are on site assessing the stability of the remaining hillside and determining the extent of the damage. \n\n\u201cThis area has a lot of clay content in the soil, and with the recent deluge, it became unstable,\u201d explained County Engineer Roger Steen. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about potential for further slides, even with the rain having stopped. We're working to determine the best course of action for stabilization and road repair.\u201d\n\n4100th Avenue is closed indefinitely between State Highway 9 and 420th Street. Motorists are advised to seek alternate routes. The Emmet County Emergency Management Agency is coordinating efforts and providing updates to the public.

The closure impacts traffic heading to and from Franklin, a town reliant on these routes for regional connections. \n\nOfficials have not yet provided an estimated timeframe for reopening SR 671. Updates will be available on VDOT\u2019s website and social media channels.
