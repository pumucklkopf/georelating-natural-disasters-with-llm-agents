      "\n",
      "**ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) —** Heavy rainfall overnight caused significant flash flooding in a residential area **1.3 km north of Baileys Crossroads**, displacing dozens of Arlington County residents and prompting emergency rescues early Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hardest-hit area, a largely residential region bisected by major roadways like US-50, SR-714 (Arlington Boulevard), and featuring a network of smaller streets, experienced rapid water level rises after a period of intense downpours. The flooding centered around North Callin Springs Road and extended from near Upton Hill to Bailey’s Crossroads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arlington County Fire Department responded to over 50 calls for assistance, including reports of flooded basements and stranded motorists. Fire officials confirmed they rescued at least 15 people from homes and vehicles, utilizing swift water rescue teams and inflatable boats. No injuries have been reported as of Tuesday afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The water rose incredibly quickly,” said resident Maria Hernandez, who was evacuated from her home on Columbia Pike. “One minute everything was fine, the next the street was a river.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Weather Service had issued a flash flood warning for Arlington County Monday evening, predicting up to three inches of rain. While the rain has subsided, officials are urging residents to avoid the affected area as crews work to assess damage and clear debris. \n",
      "\n",
      "Arlington County Emergency Management has established a temporary shelter at the Walter Reed Community Recreation Center for those displaced by the flooding. The county is also working to distribute sandbags and provide resources to impacted homeowners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Damage assessments are ongoing, but officials anticipate significant property damage, particularly to homes near North Callin Springs and along smaller creeks and drainage channels. The cause of the rapid flooding is currently under investigation, with possible contributing factors including saturated ground from recent rainfall and overwhelmed storm drains.\n",

      "**FOND DU LAC, Wis. (AP)** – A significant landslide occurred Tuesday afternoon **9.8 km northwest of Fond du Lac**, prompting a local state of emergency and temporarily closing a section of County Highway 106. While no injuries have been reported, authorities are assessing the extent of the damage and potential risks to nearby properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The landslide occurred in a largely rural area of southern Wisconsin, bisected by US Highway 41 and County Highway 106. The terrain is a mix of agricultural fields, wooded areas, and the Eldorado Wildlife Area, encompassing the Towns of Eldorado and Friendship, as well as the village of North Fond du Lac situated near the Rock River. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fond du Lac County Sheriff’s Department received reports of the slide around 2:30 PM. Initial investigations suggest unusually heavy rainfall in recent days saturated the soil, contributing to the instability of a hillside overlooking County Highway 106. The slide deposited a significant amount of earth and debris onto the roadway, making it impassable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our primary concern right now is safety,” said Sheriff Ryan Boehm in a press conference late Tuesday. “We’ve evacuated a handful of nearby residences as a precautionary measure. Geotechnical engineers are on site evaluating the slope stability and determining the best course of action for remediation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Wisconsin Department of Transportation is assisting with traffic control, diverting vehicles onto alternate routes. County Highway 106 is expected to remain closed for an extended period while crews work to clear the debris and stabilize the hillside. \n",
      "\n",
      "Officials are urging residents in the surrounding area to be aware of potential hazards, including unstable ground and further possible slides. The National Weather Service is forecasting continued rainfall for the region, raising concerns about exacerbating the situation. Further updates will be provided as the assessment progresses.\n",
