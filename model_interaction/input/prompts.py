            Please provide the search arguments for the GeoNames Websearch API for the given news article. Your task is
            specifically: \n
            1. Read the news article provided to you with the key "news_article" to understand the context of the news. \n
            2. In the article, identify all the toponyms which are provided with the key "toponym_list". \n
            3. For every toponym in the "toponym_list", provide the search arguments for the GeoNames Websearch API in JSON format. \n
            4. For this, adhere strictly to the output format {[{"toponym": "<toponym>", "params": "<search arguments>", "duplicate_of": "<toponym>"}]}. \n
            5. Make sure that the search arguments adhere strictly to the GeoNames Websearch API documentation. \n
            6. If you think that some toponyms are duplicated given the context of the news article (not necessarily the
            same name), you can just reference the first occurrence of the toponym by providing the toponym to the \n
            "duplicate_of" key in the output json. \n
            7. Usually, the search arguments "q" is the appropriate to use, and it can be provided with the toponym as the value as well as other information such as upper administrative orders. \n
            8. Usually, the search arguments "isNameRequired" is set to "true" to ensure that the search results are relevant. \n
            9. Make sure to make use of the maxRows search arguments to limit the number of results returned. \n
            10. Other than that, you can dynamically select the search arguments based on the context of the news article. \n
            11. Make sure the search arguments are as specific as possible, so that the search returns only a few, highly relevant results. \n \n
