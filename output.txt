According to the Sheriff’s Office, the man who lives in the mobile home at that address was inside the home when Henry came in and set the bed and couch on fire with a lighter. The man only knew the woman by a nickname but investigation led detectives to Henry.

Article: 41662233;Controversial pastor picked for Mansfield patrol program;Controversial pastor picked for Mansfield patrol program. By Vickie Welborn vwelborn@gannett.com Gannett March 24, 2009 MANSFIELD -- Mansfield Mayor Curtis McCoy wants to start a pastor on patrol program for the Mansfield Police Department and he's selected as his first candidate a self-described minister with a controversial past that includes time spent on the other side of the jail bars and troubles with the court system. The Rev. Roy Jones' most recent job was a convenience store clerk for which he had to obtain an alcoholic beverage control card so that he could sell alcoholic beverages. "This is something I'm trying to do to make a better relationship between the police and the citizens," McCoy said of Jones' appointment. Unlike a similar program run by the Shreveport Police Department where ministers volunteer their time to ride on patrol with officers, Mansfield's Pastor on Patrol won't depend upon volunteers - or at this point anyone beyond Jones. Jones will be paid $9 an hour and work 24 hours a week. Asked why he didn't use Shreveport's program as a model, McCoy answered, "I don't know what Shreveport does nor do I care to know what Shreveport does on that line. I only know what Mansfield is doing. "McCoy would not comment on Jones' checkered past or his ability to remain unbiased in situations involving the police and citizenry since he is on the city's payroll. "Based on his relationship in the community as far as knowing people, every time I go to church, I see him in a pulpit - I'm serious. I'm talking the honest God truth. & If he's not pastoring, he's there as a guest. But he knows the people in the community, and I think over the years he has proven himself to be an asset. "Part-time employees can work six months before being presented to the Board of Aldermen. That's why Jones' official appointment was news to two Mansfield aldermen. Mitch Lewis and G.B. "Sonny" Hall were unaware of Jones' addition to the payroll. Lewis admitted that he was questioned over the weekend about Jones being seen last week in a patrol car with a police officer. "I talked to Roy today (at the council meeting)," Lewis said Monday night. "He said yes he was doing it, but he didn't go into it. He said he was pastor on patrol. He said he was trying to get involved with the youth on the weekend and stuff like, which I think is good, but & I don't know. I think (McCoy's) intentions were good to try to set up that type of program. "Added Hall: "Most true pastors volunteer their time to do that. "Jones, who was unseated in October 2007 from his first term on the DeSoto Parish Police Jury, is a close friend of McCoy's. He's aided the mayor in his two election campaigns and frequently accompanies him to functions. Jones did not return a message left on his answering machine Monday. Jones grabbed his own headlines while on the parish governing body. He was consistently involved in employee issues and public criticism of the road department supervisor, including filing complaints with the state attorney general's office that were later deemed unfounded. The Mansfield resident got his own hand slapped in 2005 when the district attorney ordered him to reimburse the parish $175 for gravel he directed onto a private driveway. He has prior arrests for trespassing, issuing worthless checks, failure to appear in court for criminal neglect of family and for failing to report to court on issuing worthless check charges. While he spent time in the DeSoto Detention Center for his arrests, Jones has avoided jail sentences by paying off the insufficient funds and the late child support payments. McCoy said he would later evaluate the program and add a "white minister, too, because we want everyone to have someone they can talk to." Jones is black.

Article: 38563537;Senate DFL proposes cuts, $2 billion tax hike;Senate DFL proposes cuts, $2 billion tax hike. However, the DFL plan does not include $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money that lawmakers still do not know just how they can use. The Thursday announcement brought the first public acknowledgment that Democrats would increase taxes to help balance the budget. Senate Tax Chairman Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, said a "lion's share" of the $2 billion in new revenue would come from higher taxes on the rich, apparently via the income tax. The plan calls for cutting every segment of state government, for a total of $2.4 billion. While the Democratic leaders say they would take roughly equal amounts of new taxes and program cuts to balance the budget, they have yet to figure out where to put about $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money. Given that, Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller, DFL-Minneapolis, said education cuts may end up being moderated once details of how the state can spend the federal money are unraveled. The state's $33 billion two-year budget would be $6.4 billion short without cuts, new taxes and federal money. Pawlenty figures the federal money into his budget and calls the deficit $4.6 billion. He is to announce changes to his budget in the next week to 10 days, taking into account recent economic changes. Pawlenty's spokesman said it was good that DFL leaders "are finally publicly admitting they'd like to wallop the families and small businesses of Minnesota with massive tax increases." Brian McClung added that the cuts did not look at funding priorities. "An off-the-shelf computer program could do these kinds of across-the-board cuts," McClung said. "We would expect more from DFL legislators." Tom Dooher, president of Education Minnesota, was not happy with the Senate announcement. "The proposed cuts are not in the best interest of Minnesotaâ s school children," Dooher said. "If enacted, they would seriously harm the quality of education the state takes pride in providing its students." House leaders plan to announce their budget outline soon, too. House and Senate committees will work out details of their budgets, then establish conference committees to work out differences between the two budgets. Pawlenty often has said he will veto tax increases, and Pogemiller has said that he believes Pawlenty. A third of the budget balancing act Democrats propose relies on higher taxes. Bakk said he would not allow his committee to consider adding the sales tax to clothing or services. Other taxes may be considered, he said, although higher taxes on the rich are his primary goal. Bakk also said he would like to freeze the amount of money the state gives local governments at a time when most policymakers are calling for a cut in local government aid. Pawlenty would cut the aid, which has raised city leaders' ire. Local governments will be forced to enact moderate property tax increases to deal with the DFL budget, Bakk said, but less than under Pawlenty's proposal. Republican senators said they were not consulted about the proposal. They called tax increases job killers, supporting Pawlenty's proposed business tax cuts instead. Pogemiller said drastic measures such as the 7 percent cut are needed because of the current recession. Most of the cuts, he added, will be to programs most affecting the state's needy residents. He called the economy "as bad, potentially, as the 1930s." The Minnesota House unanimously voted to support freedom of the press Thursday, after a week of controversy. House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall â “ joined by House Majority Leader Tony Sertich, DFL-Chisholm â “ brought a motion to the floor voicing that support because proposed House rules would have restricted media work on the House floor and in committees. The proposed rules emerged a week ago today, creating a stir among the Capitol press corps. Then, Monday night, a committee page demanded to see credentials from a photographer â “ two hours after a House leadership spokesman assured the media that no credentials would be needed to cover committee meetings. Seifert said recent events had "a chilling effect" on the press. "I am very concerned about what has taken place recently." Sertich said the proposed rules will not be implemented. He said there has been confusion as the rules were being discussed and no changes should have been made by House staff members. Rep. Torrey Westrom, R-Elbow Lake, said the talk of stricter press rules is a sign of bigger problems with DFL leaders. "I know the press isn't really happy with some of the moves going on around here," Westrom said. "I'm glad they are speaking up." Numerous House members have told reporters that they also were not happy with the proposals.

Article: 41740820;Local volunteers join flood fighting effort in Fargo;Local volunteers join flood fighting effort in Fargo. Tastefully Simple and The Alexandria Blizzard coordinated an effort to bus 300 volunteers from the Alexandria area to the affected area Tuesday. As the National Weather Service stuck to its prediction that the Red River will crest at 39 to 41 feet in Fargo-Moorhead on Friday, the mounting stress of a potential record flood began to take its toll. â Fear is setting in,â said Salvation Army Captain Adam Moore. â Weâ re seeing that on the streets. â As of 8:15 p.m. Monday, the Red River level in Fargo was 27.58 feet. Weather service officials warned that a storm system moving into the Red River Valley from Nebraska overnight could drop up to an inch of rain over a widespread area before the rain turns to snow Wednesday. Despite sporadic showers Monday, Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker said the city â had a good day. â Fargo tried to speed up the dike-building process by deploying a portable wall system thatâ s used to protect soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan from bullets and grenades. Sharon Mueller watched from near her home just off 40th Avenue South as a payloader filled a wall of the Hesco containers with sand. Under the road, large ice chunks floated down the swollen Drain 27. Mueller, a retired bartender, said she couldnâ t believe how fast the rising water was running. She said that despite her husbandâ s complacency, she was worried about flooding. â Can you imagine what Noah must have felt like? â she said. Sandbagging hit high gear in the metro, as high schools let out students and colleges canceled classes to aid the effort. North Dakota Governor John Hoeven said students would be forgiven for missed school days. About 30 Concordia College students stacked sandbags around Barb Grothâ s house in Oakport Township north of Moorhead, where several hundred volunteers pitched in. Groth, whose home flooded in 1997 when the Red River crested at 39.57 feet, said she didnâ t think a repeat was possible. â I never thought it could happen again. Weâ re nervous,â she said. Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty stopped in Oakport and Moorhead, urging state residents to join the flood fight. About 230 Minnesota National Guard troops were helping with flood efforts, and he said he expects that number will eventually reach about 400. Hoeven said the stateâ s National Guard committed 500 soldiers to the water war, with more available. Fargo raised its goal for daily sandbag output to 300,000 to try to fill 2 million bags by Thursday. â If those neighborhoods hold, we are safe as a city,â said Fargo City Commissioner Tim Mahoney. â If weâ re unable to do that, weâ re going to have a problem. â The city was prepared for a Red River crest of 38 feet. Now, city officials want to get the dikes up to 42 feet, Mahoney said. At 41 feet â we lose a lot of houses,â he said. â If weâ re going to get this thing done, itâ s going to have to be done in the next 24 to 48 hours in a massive way. â The Fargodome, where volunteers waited for bus rides to Sandbag Central, the cityâ s utilities building, became its own sandbag-filling station with hundreds of shovel-wielding volunteers scooping sand dumped on the parking lot. Sandbaggers kept spirits up despite the gloomy weather and flood outlook. Fargo plans to give residents routes out of town Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, said Pat Zavoral, Fargo city administrator. â There are some locations in south Fargo where if the water does break away from these [dikes], they wonâ t be able to use Interstate-29,â he said. Fargo Police Chief Keith Ternes urged residents to go to the cityâ s Web site and register for the Code Red alert system so they can be reached in an emergency. Residents with land lines are already registered in the system. Sandbagging efforts continued overnight. City officials hope they get 300 people an hour to help fill sandbags at the cityâ s utility operation center at 2301 8th Ave. N. and 1,000 people an hour at the Fargodome. Hoeven asked for a presidential emergency declaration based on preparation efforts because of the costs. He said he thinks the state might get it today.
